# TianGong LCA Data Foundry

Control plane for turning external source material into validated, import-ready TIDAS data.

Foundry is intentionally thin. It owns task routing, local workspaces, import profiles, curation packages, cleanup reports, stable owner-command adapters, and policy checks. Deterministic package import/conversion/schema validation belongs to unified Rust `tidas`; contract context, QA, curation, skills, and database behavior belongs in `tiangong-lca-cli`, `tidas-sdk`, `tiangong-lca-skills`, Edge Functions, or database projects.

Identity-preflight candidate requests use the current Hybrid Search contract: one `lexical_weight` for the database `extracted_md` branch and one `semantic_weight` for `embedding_ft`.

## Toolchain And Typed Spine

Foundry is a pnpm-only Node.js 24 project. The reproducible toolchain is `pnpm@11.23.0`, TypeScript `7.0.2` as the only compiler anywhere in the dependency graph, Oxlint for linting, and Prettier for formatting. The repository keeps one root `pnpm-workspace.yaml` and `pnpm-lock.yaml`; npm/Yarn lockfiles, TypeScript 5/6 aliases, `@typescript-eslint`, and TypeScript-compiler-backed formatting plugins are outside the supported graph.

Issue #63 starts the typed spine without pretending that the existing JavaScript estate is already migrated. At the baseline commit, 160 tracked JavaScript artifacts comprise 95 runtime `.mjs` files (59,692 lines), 64 `.mjs` tests (30,273 lines), and one Prettier `.cjs` config. `specs/typescript-migration-inventory.json` records that boundary. Entrypoints, command metadata/registry, runtime I/O, and artifact/receipt contracts migrate first; command families and tests follow under characterization and real-case TDD. A module leaves the inventory only when its typed replacement and behavior evidence pass.

Every toolchain or migration change must also pass from a clean arbitrary Git worktree: install with `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`, then run the canonical lint, typecheck, build, toolchain, and test gates without borrowing sibling checkouts, another worktree's `node_modules`, ignored `.foundry` artifacts, or credentials.

The Golden gate checks normalized command artifacts against a non-`HEAD` merge-base (normally `origin/main`) with a Node-native recursive comparator, so committed PR changes cannot degrade into a self-comparison and Windows runners do not depend on a Unix `diff` binary. Script-backed test executables such as fake TIDAS run through `process.execPath` on every platform, and `.gitattributes` keeps repository text at LF so Prettier observes the same bytes on every checkout.

Artifact paths recorded by fixtures and command parsers must accept both platform separators. Durable JSON writers fsync the same writable descriptor they opened; POSIX permission-bit assertions apply only where the operating system implements those bits.

## Import Lanes

- `external-dataset-curated-import`: packaged LCA datasets converted through the Foundry adapter over Rust `tidas import`, with default per-process dependency bundles under `process-bundles/`, then validated by Rust tidas, QA checked, curated, cleaned, dry-run, committed, and verified through queue/checkpoint-driven scopes.
- `source-evidence-dataset-development`: PDF, Excel, web exports, images, markdown, or free text extracted through CLI/skills, authored into candidate TIDAS rows with source evidence, then sent through the same validation and curation gates.

Raw rows may preserve source-language text, but final import/write-ready rows must include English for TIDAS-required multilingual fields while preserving non-English source-language variants.

For a newer release over an existing owner-draft import, use the incremental lane instead of rebuilding or rewriting every row. `dataset-incremental-change-set-compose` strictly validates a SHA-bound old/candidate/current request plus owner-snapshot receipt, then emits only INSERT/UPDATE candidates, explicit NOOP/HOLD ledgers, dependency order, a non-empty CLI execution contract when actions exist, and exactly one terminal JSONL log event per schema-valid conversion. Entity/path/value/evidence-bound rules preserve reviewed work without opening whole rows; unstable arrays and absent dependencies hold only their closure. The command is offline and non-authoritative; fresh reconciliation and capsule admission remain separate gates. See `docs/incremental-change-set-contract.md`.

When the release changes flow identities or ordered process exchanges, use `dataset-topology-convergence-compose` after a fresh SELECT-only census. It keys exchanges by process UUID, source exchange number, and occurrence; preserves owner non-exchange content plus approved German/Chinese nodes; emits separate F flow-create and P process-save contracts; and leaves D as zero-inbound delete candidates for the CLI maintenance barrier. See `docs/topology-convergence-contract.md`.

```

Tests are organized by behavior layer in `test/README.md`. Use `pnpm test` for the full suite and `pnpm test:unit|test:commands|test:scenarios` for targeted checks; `pnpm test:toolchain` protects the pnpm/TS7 contract. Old incident-numbered test aliases are not part of the maintained surface.

Use owner-routed execution commands for dataset work:

```bash
node scripts/foundry.mjs dataset-tidas-import \
  --input ./source-package \
  --output ./.foundry/workspaces/<task-id>/conversion

node scripts/foundry.mjs dataset-tidas-validate \
  --rows-file ./rows/processes.jsonl \
  --type process \
  --out-dir ./schema

pnpm exec tiangong-lca dataset curation-queue build \
  --processes ./rows/processes.jsonl \
  --flows ./rows/flows.jsonl \
  --support ./rows/sources.jsonl \
  --out-dir ./curation-queue

pnpm exec tiangong-lca dataset curation-queue next \
  --queue-dir ./curation-queue \
  --json

pnpm exec tiangong-lca dataset curation-queue verify \
  --queue-dir ./curation-queue \
  --type process \
  --json

node scripts/foundry.mjs dataset-curation-gate \
  --type process \
  --rows-file ./rows/processes.jsonl \

  --queue-dir ./curation-queue \
  --classification-queue ./classification-authoring-queue.jsonl \
  --location-queue ./location-authoring-queue.jsonl \
  --identity-preflight-index ./identity-preflight-requests/identity-preflight-requests.jsonl \
  --profile bafu
```

Foundry does not expose dataset package-script aliases. Queue state belongs to the exact installed CLI via `pnpm exec tiangong-lca dataset curation-queue build/next/verify`; conversion, validation, QA, remote write/delete/redo, and readback verification belong to CLI-owned commands and checked-in skills. Foundry-local dataset commands are policy and artifact helpers only: curation packages, mutation manifests, commit handoff plans, closeout checks, and task completion reports.

`process-bundles/index.json` is a generic packaged-import contract, not a BAFU-only path. Bundle `manifest` and `tidas_dir` entries may be relative to the index directory; Foundry resolves them before scope projection. A batch runner may process independent bundle/entity tasks in parallel when the queue lock and dependency checks allow it. The configured parallelism belongs in the task workspace policy, and completed scopes should continue through commit and readback automatically when all hard gates pass. Missing public canonical unit groups, flow properties, or elementary flows are blocked by default; a frozen profile may instead authorize an account-local `state_code=0` candidate path that keeps private support outside the public cache and proves owner, unit-scale, closure, audit, and readback. Schema/QA blockers and unresolved reference closure always stay out of executable commit scopes. Each run that defers scopes writes both `blocked-scope-ledger.jsonl` for complete row-level blocker facts and `blocked-scope-report.json` for reason, affected-scope, dependency, human-action, and rerun summaries.

The operational entry point for the BAFU 2025 V2 full import — directory map, full command templates, blocker triage, and the current resume checklist — is `docs/bafu-import-runbook.md`.

For BAFU ready-scope resumes, `dataset-bafu-batch-import-run` supports `--pending-only` to filter already verified and active human-review scopes before `--limit`, `--selection-order estimated-weight-asc` to process lighter scopes first, `--pause-file` for graceful operator pauses, and `--stop-after-blocked <n>` to stop claiming new scopes once a blocker pattern is repeating. When starting a fresh batch directory, pass one or more `--ledger-source-dir <previous-batch-or-import-ledger-dir>` values so `--pending-only` can carry forward prior `ok.scopes.verified`, `ok.flows.verified`, active blocked scopes, and verified support identities while the new batch still writes its own independent ledgers. `--preflight-only` writes a read-only selected-scope plan without requiring `--commit` or starting remote writes. The runner also maintains `import-ledger/verified-support-identities.jsonl`; verified contact/source support closeouts are cached there so later flow/process scopes can reuse already verified support identities instead of repeating support commit and readback. Use `dataset-bafu-universe-coverage-report` with explicit `--ledger-source-dir` values to compare the full input `process-bundles/index.json` and `tidas/processes` universe against ready scopes, verified ledgers, retry ledgers, active blockers, and process-referenced product flow coverage. Retryable tool/network failures such as npm registry lookup failures are written to `failed.scopes.retry.jsonl` instead of active human-review.

Whole-library packaged imports should first deduplicate root TIDAS entities, then project the resulting decisions back to process scopes:

```bash
node scripts/foundry.mjs dataset-library-index-build \
  --source-dir <converted-library-root> \
  --process-bundles-dir <converted-library-root>/process-bundles \
  --out-dir <run-dir>/library-index

node scripts/foundry.mjs dataset-library-authoring-plan \
  --library-index <run-dir>/library-index \
  --out-dir <run-dir>/authoring-plan

node scripts/foundry.mjs dataset-library-decisions-apply \
  --library-index <run-dir>/library-index \
  --decisions-dir <run-dir>/decisions \
  --out-dir <run-dir>/library-resolution

node scripts/foundry.mjs dataset-process-scope-run \
  --process-bundles-dir <converted-library-root>/process-bundles \
  --library-resolution <run-dir>/library-resolution/library-resolution.json \
  --scope-file <run-dir>/library-resolution/scope-checkpoints.jsonl \
  --parallel 5 \
  --dry-run
```

`dataset-library-decisions-apply` writes `<run-dir>/library-resolution/blocked-scope-report.json` every time it evaluates scope closure. `dataset-process-scope-run` writes `<run-dir>/process-scope-run/blocked-scope-report.json` for runner-level deferrals such as non-ready scopes.

`annualSupplyOrProductionVolume` remains a required process field. When source data does not provide it, Foundry uses the deterministic `9999 missing-data-sentinel/year` value rather than AI trace deferral. The sentinel is intentionally non-physical and easy to bulk search so later database-side curation can replace it; that replacement is outside Foundry's import task.

For process rows whose source exchange list is truly output-only, pass the original converted source rows to cleanup with `--source-rows-file`. Foundry may then write deterministic `sourceExchangeCompleteness` proof only when the source row is output-only and the final row preserves the non-flow-reference exchange signature; otherwise AI `source_trace_verified` evidence or exchange repair is still required.

`--profile generic` is the default. Dataset-specific behavior is configured in `specs/import-profiles.json`; BAFU is one profile, not a special code path.

## Runtime Skills

`.agents/skills` is the single project-visible skill root. Foundry-local skills are tracked there by git; shared/runtime skills are also installed there when needed, but their names are managed by `.agents/shared-skills.json` and their installed directories remain ignored unless a task explicitly chooses pinned reproducibility.

Use the `skills` registry package through pnpm before a task needs shared skills:

```bash
pnpm skills:install:shared
pnpm skills:update
pnpm skills:list
```

For deleting, retiring, repairing, or redoing rows from a bad import under current-user RLS, route to the checked-in `tiangong-lca-skills` `$dataset-rls-maintenance` workflow and the CLI-owned `pnpm exec tiangong-lca dataset maintenance plan/apply/verify` surface. Do not add Foundry-local Supabase delete or redo commands.

For document fulltext extraction and SCI literature evidence, use the latest remote skills from `https://github.com/tiangong-ai/skills`:

```bash
pnpm dlx skills@latest use https://github.com/tiangong-ai/skills \
  --skill document-granular-decompose \
  --full-depth

pnpm dlx skills@latest use https://github.com/tiangong-ai/skills \
  --skill tiangong-kb-sci-search \
  --full-depth

git ls-remote https://github.com/tiangong-ai/skills.git refs/heads/main
```

Persistent local installs are optional operator state:

```bash
pnpm dlx skills@latest add https://github.com/tiangong-ai/skills \
  --skill tiangong-kb-sci-search document-granular-decompose \
  --agent '*' \
  --yes \
  --full-depth
pnpm skills:update
```

Installed shared runtime skills such as `.agents/skills/tiangong-kb-sci-search/`, `.agents/skills/document-granular-decompose/`, `.agents/skills/external-dataset-curated-import/`, and `skills-lock.json` remain ignored by default. Source-evidence tasks should record the resolved upstream ref, `pnpm dlx skills` command, and evidence artifacts under `.foundry/workspaces/<task-id>/runtime-skills/`.

- `scripts/lib/import-curation.mjs`: generic dataset curation/cleanup implementation.
- `.agents/shared-skills.json`: configured Foundry-local and shared runtime skills that may appear under `.agents/skills`.
- `specs/automated-lca-capability-registry.json`: capability routing registry.
- `specs/import-profiles.json`: data-driven import profiles.

Remote writes are never ungated. A task must pass schema, QA, curation, cleanup, dry-run, mutation-manifest/reference-closure, commit handoff, and post-write verification gates before any database mutation. When deterministic source/contact rewrites create a writable shared contact or source dependency, Foundry may prepare a separate support finalize/handoff artifact, but dependent process/flow/lifecyclemodel scopes remain blocked until that support row is committed through the published CLI and verified. When the task write policy permits automated batch commit, ready scopes may commit without per-row human approval; human input is reserved for policy changes, exceptional waivers, and support gaps not already covered by a frozen profile's explicit account-local policy.
